# Weather-App
Weather Forecasting Application is one of the most common mini project in Software Development . In this article, we are going to make a Weather Forecasting Application from scratch which will tell us the weather of any location using its name . We will be covering all the steps you have to do while developing this mini project. The title of our project will be Todays Weather App.
# Forecasts
Weather apps provide forecasts for the day, hour, or minute, and can include information like high temperatures, precipitation levels, and air quality
# Current conditions
Weather apps can provide information about the current temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed
# API Security
API Key Management: Ensures that only authorized apps or services can access the backend data. This includes using API keys, tokens, and rate limiting to prevent abuse.
Secure Coding Practices: Protect against common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)) that could compromise the app's security.
